## Overview

Where do you go to find social services in your area? According to our survey, most people resort to a broad internet search. The issue however is that a general internet search rarely yields the type of information you’re looking for. Many nonprofits and NGOs don’t have all their information publicly available, or are lacking up to date info. Maybe you’ve recently been laid off and are in need of employment assistance. Or you might be a parent in search of child care and local family centers. Or maybe you’ve recently moved to town and are curious how to connect with your local community. Sometimes you don’t even know what you are searching for, but you need help. Creating an application that helps users narrow and filter their search by location and type, and also is comprehensive can help. That’s where Nearby comes in!


### The challenge

- Find a dateset containg a list of all places that offer social services in Berlin
- Designing and developing a serach box with filter options

## Our process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Python
- Flask
- Pandas
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### Continued development

Our next step would be to implement a map, so users can search for a social service based on their location.
