## Overview

Where do you go to find social services in your area? According to our survey, most people resort to a broad internet search. The issue however is that a general internet search rarely yields the type of information youâ€™re looking for. Many nonprofits and NGOs donâ€™t have all their information publicly available, or are lacking up to date info. Maybe youâ€™ve recently been laid off and are in need of employment assistance. Or you might be a parent in search of child care and local family centers. Or maybe youâ€™ve recently moved to town and are curious how to connect with your local community. Sometimes you donâ€™t even know what you are searching for, but you need help. Creating an application that helps users narrow and filter their search by location and type, and also is comprehensive can help. Thatâ€™s where Nearby comes in!

### What we learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

Our next would be to implement a map, so users can search for a social service based on their location.
